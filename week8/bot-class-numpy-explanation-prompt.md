Analyze the provided Python code snippet defining the `Bot` class. For *every* instance where the NumPy library (imported as `np`) is used, provide a detailed explanation covering:
1.  Which specific NumPy function or constant is being used.
2.  What exact calculation or operation is being performed (e.g., generating a random integer between X and Y, calculating the sine of an angle).
3.  What the purpose of this calculation is within the context of the `Bot` class (e.g., initializing position, calculating geometry for drawing, setting up random behavior).
    Ensure the explanation covers random number generation (`np.random`), constants (`np.pi`), and trigonometric functions (`np.sin`, `np.cos`).
